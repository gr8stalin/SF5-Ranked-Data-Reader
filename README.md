# SF5 Ranked Data Reader
Python script for parsing the Excel sheet I used to track my ranked progress to Diamond rank in SF5.

This script takes in my Excel sheet and spits out the data as a .json file, which I intend to use as a "database"
for an accompanying data visualization project.

Part of this project is just about reviewing some of my Python knowledge and filling in some gaps in my knowledge.
